# 🐍 Python Scripts Diary

This repo is basically my **Python glow-up in code form**. It contains all the scripts I wrote while going through my Python bootcamp, from my first shaky lines of code to solving real problems with logic and confidence.

What you’ll find here:
- Daily Python practice (yes, I coded almost every day 😤)
- Concepts from basics to intermediate Python
- Tons of trial, error, debugging, and “ohhh THAT’S why” moments
- A noticeable upgrade in my **problem-solving skills**

💀 Funny story: I *was* coding consistently… I just kept forgetting to push my commits. So if the commit history looks quiet at times, trust me, the grind was still happening.

This is not just a collection of scripts — it’s a record of my **learning curve, consistency, and progress as a developer**.
It is my **proof of consistency, growth, and learning out loud in code**.

⚡ Still learning. Still breaking things. Still improving.
